# **Advanced AI Negotiation Chatbot**

## **Overview**
The **Advanced AI Negotiation Chatbot** is an AI-driven system that simulates a real-world negotiation process. It allows users to interact with a virtual salesperson by making offers for a product, while the AI calculates and responds with realistic pricing based on customer loyalty, competitor prices, and product features.

This chatbot uses Google’s Gemini Generative AI model to create dynamic and flexible interactions, making it an ideal tool for sales negotiations and customer interactions in a business setting.
